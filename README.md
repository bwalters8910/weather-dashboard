# weather-dashboard

## Description
This is a weather app that uses a free weather API to display current weather conditions, as well as a five day forcast for the city entered by the user. It also utilizes local storage to create buttons for previously searched cities. My motivation for creating this project was to get even more practice with API calls and manipulating data. This app gives users the ability to check the weather conditions anywhere in the world, and would be helpful for everyday use or if you're planning a trip! During this project I learned that the development process never ends (in a good way!). I will continue to work on this code and improve on it's functionality until I'm happy with it.

## Installation
You can download the repo for this app at (https://github.com/bwalters8910/weather-dashboard). Or you can visit the deployed app at (https://bwalters8910.github.io/weather-dashboard/).

## Usage
To use the app, just type a city into the search bar and click "submit". If you refresh the page, or revisting the page later, your past searches will be listed as buttons which can be clicked for ease of use.
